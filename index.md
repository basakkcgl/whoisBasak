### My research interests

AI Alignment - Formal methods for AI - Causality - [NeuroAI](https://xcorr.files.wordpress.com/2022/12/neuroai-big-tent-page-1.png) 

**Specifically**:

<!--  I enjoy working on "edge cases". In science and engineering, we easily get carried away with the success/prediction rates of our models and how "well" they perform. But, oftentimes, our models do poorly at trivial(?) tasks and we do not exactly know why. Most likely explanation is due to the naive assumptions we had to make for the sake of simplicity or computational complexity. -->

I have genuine interest in corner cases where our models don't function as expected. Instead of ignoring such cases, I try to find out why they don't work - which would shed light on why they did work at first place.

I am interested in fault tracing via causality analysis concerning the fundamental problems in AI alignment. To enable safety in AI systems, I believe, there is an urgent need for developing novel methods to verify the system functioning with certain formal guarantees.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/basakkcgl/whoisbasak/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/basakkcgl/whoisbasak/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
