# So, who is Basak ?

I work on explainable AI. Once we have some explanation on **why** do they do what they do, I want to create machines that are better (more efficient and robust in learning) than humans. I try to achieve that by *'translating'* what we know from neuroscience into machines. And sometimes I go the other way around, and look into latest deep learning methods to understand brain.

### XAI to scifi?
I am interested in structure-function relations. So basically I try to understand how structure (neural architecture) give rise to functions (anything you can thinkg of, learning etc.). But, also from evolution, we know that function (as an emergent property of complex networks/interactions) give rise to [new] structures. And sometimes (actually perhaps more accurate to say, oftentimes) a weird thing happens: different structures (hence carrying different functions) do serve same function after some perturbation, or lesion. This weird phenomenon (also referred as degeneracy, multiple solutions, functional overlap, etc.) is my main research across different complex systems. I try to come up with a mathematical framework to formulate this phenomenon. One I formulate that, then we can make machines (or any other network systems) more resilient and more efficient to the tasks we favor. 

### since when?
Degeneracy (or ...) was my biggest leverage against the causal models. I studied all the models (at least up until 2018 - when I defended my MA thesis) to model/infer causal relations in complex systems (such as brain) and pointed out that all of them **except one** either have *costly* assumptions in the model that don't apply for **nonlinear** systems, or they just don't generalize at all. That exception was called **counterfactual** models of causality and basically I did not much have to argue against it. **But** then I **showed** that counterfactual models cannot apply in cases where the system is highly degenerate.  So, I won (philosophically speaking). And since then I try to mathematically formalize this weird phenomenon that got me passed my MA defense (thank you degeneracy!).

## A short bio, aka. trajectory of my highly nonlinear curiosty (and so, the career followed) from 2011 to now:

A classical music literate in highschool, initially aimed to graduate from London College of Music but went to college as an Interior Design and Fine Arts student in Antalya, TR, but then got invested in understanding the ability of symbolic reasoning across evolutionary history (spec., primates) and graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, did a master’s heavily focused on logic and theory of computation at METU; in the meantime, attended two summer schools (LMU-Munich, Germany and KLI, Austria); had a pre-doctoral training on neurosciences at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA; currently research assistant at the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences working on computational neuroscience (with a specialty on reinforcement learning and predictive coding); headed to the attractor ‘AI engineering’.
