Bio:
# Trajectory of my highly nonlinear curiosty (and so, the career followed) from 2011 to now:

A classical music student in highschool, initially aimed to graduate from London College of Music but went to college as an Interior Design and Fine Arts student in Antalya, TR, graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, did a master’s heavily focused on logic and theory of computation at METU; attended two summer schools (LMU-Munich in Germany and KLI in Austria) in the meantime; had a pre-doctoral training on neurosciences at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA; currently research assistant at the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences working on computational neuroscience (with a specialty on reinforcement learning and predictive coding); headed to the attractor point of ‘AI engineering’.

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
