# Who is Basak (*pronounced as Bashak)?
## Trajectory of my highly nonlinear curiosty (and so, the career followed) from 2011 to now:

A classical music literate in highschool, initially aimed to graduate from London College of Music but went to college as an Interior Design and Fine Arts student in Antalya, TR, but then got invested in understanding the ability of symbolic reasoning across evolutionary history (spec., primates) and graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, did a master’s heavily focused on logic and theory of computation at METU; attended two summer schools (LMU-Munich, Germany and KLI, Austria) in the meantime; had a pre-doctoral training on neurosciences at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA; currently research assistant at the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences working on computational neuroscience (with a specialty on reinforcement learning and predictive coding); headed to the attractor point of ‘AI engineering’.
