Please check out [About](./_pages/aboutme.html) to see my bio and personal research history.

I enjoy working on "edge cases". In science and engineering, we easily get carried away with the success/prediction rates of our models and how "well" they perform. But, oftentimes, our models do poorly at trivial(?) tasks due to the naive assumptions we had to make for the sake of simplicity or computational complexity. I have genuine interest in edge cases where our models don't work at all. Instead of ignoring such cases, I try to find out why they don't work.

### My research interests
In particular, I am interested in edge cases concerning the fundamental problems in explainable AI. Once we have some explanation on **why** neural networks do they do what they do (which requires questioning **causality** in the network), I want to create machines that are more efficient and robust in learning. I try to achieve that by *"translating"* what we know from neuroscience into machines. And sometimes I go the other way around, and play around with machine learning methods to get some insights on brains.

### XAI or Sci-Fi?
On a broader scope, I am interested in structure-function relations. So, basically, I try to understand how structure (neural architecture) gives rise to functions (learning, behavior etc., or dysfunctions like brain disorders). But, also from evolution, we know that function (as an emergent property of complex networks/interactions) gives rise to [new] structures. And sometimes (perhaps more accurate to say, oftentimes) **a weird thing** happens: different structures (hence carrying different causative functions) do serve the same function after some perturbation, or lesion. This weird phenomenon (also referred as degeneracy, multiple solutions, functional overlap, etc.) is my main research across different complex systems. I try to come up with a mathematical framework to formulate this phenomenon. Once I formulate that, then we can make machines (or any other networked systems) more resilient and more efficient for the tasks we favor. 

### weird thing?
Degeneracy (or functional redundancy) was my biggest leverage against most of the causal models. I studied available theories of causation (at least up until 2017/2018 - when I defended my master's thesis) that are used for modeling and inferring causal relations in complex systems (such as brain) and pointed out that most of them **except one** either have *costly* assumptions in the models that don't apply for **nonlinear** systems, or they just don't generalize at all. That exception was called **counterfactual** theory of causation and basically I did not have much to argue against it. But then **I found** that counterfactual models cannot apply in cases where the system is highly degenerate.  So, I won (philosophically speaking). And since then I try to mathematically formalize this weird phenomenon that got me passed my master's thesis defense (thank you, weird thing!).
