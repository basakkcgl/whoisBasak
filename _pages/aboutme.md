## Trajectory of my highly nonlinear curiosty (hence the career followed):

A classical music literate in highschool, initially aimed to graduate from London College of Music but went to uni as an Interior Design and Fine Arts student in Antalya, but then got invested in understanding the ability of symbolic reasoning across evolutionary history (spec., primates) and graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, followed with a masterâ€™s heavily focused on logic, formal reasoning, and theory of computation at [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/); in the meantime, attended two summer schools ([LMU-Munich, Germany](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html) and [KLI, Austria](https://www.kli.ac.at/)); had a pre-doctoral training in neurosciences at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA. During the pandemic summer, was TAing (7+ hours daily for 3 weeks) at [Neuromatch Academy and Python Bootcamp](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy) and the following extended-quarantine summer, selected to be a Lead-TA Consultant.

Until recently I was a research assistant at the [Center for Connected Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/c2a2/) under the supervison of <a href="(https://faculty.eng.fau.edu/dimitrispados/)" style="color: black;">**Prof. Pados**</a>. 

<!-- After a long time in the U.S. (due to COVID and some related issues)-->

<!--at the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences working on computational neuroscience (with a specialty on reinforcement learning and predictive coding)-->
