## Academically:


I got invested in understanding the ability of symbolic reasoning across evolutionary history (spec., primates) and graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, followed with a master’s heavily focused on logic, formal reasoning, and theory of computation at [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/); in the meantime, attended two summer schools ([LMU-Munich, Germany](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html) and [KLI, Austria](https://www.kli.ac.at/)); had a pre-doctoral training in neurosciences at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA. During the pandemic summer, was TAing at [NMA Computational Neuroscience Summer School](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy).
For the last couple years in South Florida, I was a research assistant at the [Center for Connected Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/c2a2/) under the supervison of <a href="(https://faculty.eng.fau.edu/dimitrispados/)" style="color: black;">**Prof. Pados**</a>. I re-joined the NMA team as a Project-TA for the inaugural advanced course on NeuroAI in 2024 Summer.

Currently working with Drs. Paoletti and Watson at King's College London while also being affiliated with Imperial College London through Safe and Trusted AI CDT Programme.

## Personally:
In my spare time I enjoy studying art history & theory. I like to draw (and oil paint, mostly) here and there. My biggest inspiration is the archeological sites alongside the Aegean (where I am originally from). Not big on sports, but I am committed to yoga/barre and -whenever possible- practicing archery and snowboarding.
