## Trajectory of my highly nonlinear curiosty (hence the career followed):

A classical music literate in highschool, initially aimed to graduate from London College of Music but went to college as an Interior Design and Fine Arts student in Antalya, but then got invested in understanding the ability of symbolic reasoning across evolutionary history (spec., primates) and graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, followed with a masterâ€™s heavily focused on logic, formal reasoning, and theory of computation at [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/); in the meantime, attended two summer schools ([LMU-Munich, Germany](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html) and [KLI, Austria](https://www.kli.ac.at/)); had a pre-doctoral training on neuroscience at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA. 

Until recently I was a research assistant at the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences working on computational neuroscience (with a specialty on reinforcement learning and predictive coding) and at the [Center for Connected Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/c2a2/). After a long time in the U.S. (due to COVID and some related issues) I am making my way back to where I truly feel at home =  EU!

Warning: If ever got missing, can be found in museums (fine arts, ancient Greek, or natural history) sitting on the floor and sketching some ideas. Or, if any sea/ocean is nearby, probably complaining about the water quality not matching my standards (translates as, "being Aegean").
