## Academically:


I got invested in understanding the ability of symbolic reasoning across evolutionary history (spec., primates) and graduated as a philosopher of (cognitive) science, followed with a masterâ€™s heavily focused on logic, formal reasoning, and theory of computation at [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/); in the meantime, attended two summer schools ([LMU-Munich, Germany](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/about/index.html) and [KLI, Austria](https://www.kli.ac.at/)); had a pre-doctoral training in neurosciences at the Brain Institute in Florida, USA. During the pandemic summer, was TAing at [NMA Computational Neuroscience Summer School](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy).

Until recently I was a research assistant at the [Center for Connected Autonomy and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.fau.edu/engineering/research/c2a2/) under the supervison of <a href="(https://faculty.eng.fau.edu/dimitrispados/)" style="color: black;">**Prof. Pados**</a>.

## Personally:
In my spare time I enjoy studying art history & theory. I like to draw (oil, mostly) here and there. My biggest inspiration is the archeological sites alongside the Aegean (where I am originally from). Not big on sports, but I am committed to yoga/barre and -whenever possible- practicing archery and snowboarding. 

Currently reading: <!-- "After the end of art" by Arthur Danto. -->
